  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Our first moment</h3>
  <p align="center">May 16th, 2025, the start of something beautiful, that moment where you told me that you liked me, lots of emotions rushed in, the past, present or the future weren't of any meaning, that moment with you, my timeline collapsed, the moment you hugged me, that moment, I forgot everything, the only thing I knew mattered was you, the person who despite having been through so much still had the bravery and courage to join me, to make "my" voyage, ours.</p>
  <p align="center">I will forever be grateful to you for this moment. Thank you Trishaa</p>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;">That Day</h3>
  <p align="center">May 19th, 2025, the day I finally asked you to be mine, that day in the evening when you told me that we could meet, I knew in that moment this day was going to be special, I didn't know what it was that I was going to do, but I knew for a fact that the day we met right after us having confessed to each other would be a special day, Having fought my mother to let me go see the love of my life, I ran towards your house scared that you might not be able to come because of the rain but the moment I saw you there, in front of you gate just standing a smiling at me, I knew for a fact that you were never going to let me down ever. It rained quite heavily that evening, I knew that day that it was going to be a long time before I get to meet you again, Soo I wanted to make sure that I do not miss out of the things that I had made a checklist of in my mind. Although I almost forgot all about it when you hugged me, but I managed to squeeze in the "will you be my girlfriend" and most importantly our first kiss as well. I had never been happier, I went back home incredibly content and happy spent the entire night chatting with you, it was beautiful.</p>
